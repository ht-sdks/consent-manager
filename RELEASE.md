### Publishing New Version

This package follows semantic versioning. To publish a new version:

1. Create a new GitHub Release using a semantic version tag (eg. `0.0.1`).
   - A new package will be published to NPM automatically via GitHub Actions. No need to manually bump any versions since the GH Action will automatically set the version based on the git tag.
